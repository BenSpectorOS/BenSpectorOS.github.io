#### Instructions:

1. In the code editor, you'll see a few lines of code already written. However, each of them has syntax errors.

2. Take a look closely at each line of code. The program as a whole should contain a variable declaration statement, followed by an if-else statement, like so:

```javascript
var myBooly = true;

if (myBooly) {
  console.log('myBooly is True');
} else {
  console.log('myBooly is False');
}
```
3. On each line of code, look for syntax errors. They can include missing semicolons, missing or unnecessary braces, missing or unnecessary parenthesis, and the like. 

4. Alter the pre-existing code to remove all sytax errors. The end result should be a variable declaration statement, followed by an if else statement that will print 'It's correct!" to the console after it's run.

5. Run the tests in the code editor to make sure your code is fully debugged - all three tests should pass!
